# POMO-iphone

This fork is to show the possibilities and limitations for using GetText in Swift projects. 

This repository includes a Xcode workspace with the pomo-iphone lib, an example project in Objective-C, an example project in Swift and a totally hacky Python script to extract translatable strings from Swift source files. 

The https://github.com/pronebird/pomo-iphone library does work with a few modifications. Main limitation is a lack of support for the Swift programming langugage in *xgettext*. If you have any comment regarding please feel free to contact me. 



----
POMO-iphone is a gettext translations for iPhone written in Objective-C. It supposed to be a good substitution for outdated Apple translations system. However I still use default mechanisms to translate settings.bundle and Storyboard, so this solution is not 100% perfect.

## Basic usage

```objective-c

// Import POMO-iPhone with Gettext helper methods
#import "GettextHelpers.h"

// Load default textdomain, TEXTDOMAIN constant defined in GettextHelpers.h
// Make sure you created a default-xx.po file in your app resources
// Call somewhere in -(BOOL)application:willFinishLaunchingWithOptions:
[[TranslationCenter sharedCenter] loadTextDomain:DEFAULT_TEXTDOMAIN];

NSInteger numApples = 10;

// Translate single string
NSLog(@"Gettext translated string: %@", _(@"Hi, this is gettext!"));

// Translate plural string
NSLog(@"Gettext translated plural: %@", _n(@"%d apple", @"%d apples", numApples));

// Translate and format altogether
NSLog(@"Gettext translated plural: %@", [NSString stringWithFormat:_n(@"%d apple", @"%d apples", numApples), numApples]);

```

For more information, see:

* [GettextHelpers.h](https://github.com/pronebird/pomo-iphone/blob/master/pomo-iphone/GettextHelpers.h)
* [TranslationCenter.h](https://github.com/pronebird/pomo-iphone/blob/master/pomo-iphone/TranslationCenter.h)

## TranslationCenter

TranslationCenter is a manager for textdomains and strings' translations, it has few options that you can override. To obtain a shared center use the following code:

```objective-c

TranslationCenter* translator = [TranslationCenter sharedCenter];
```

- `translator.defaultPath` - by default it's path to your app bundle
- `translator.language` - by default it's current UI language

You can use TranslationCenter directly to translate strings, however it's not really handy, so I suggest using GettextHelpers which provide shorthandle functions for the frequently used functions.

## Single textdomain shorthandles

Single textdomain shorthandles use default textdomain and help you to keep your code shorter if you don't need more than one textdomain in your app.

`_(singular)` - single string translation

`_n(singular, plural, number)` - plural translation

`_x(singular, context)` - single string translation with context

`_nx(singular, plural, number, context)` - plural translation with context

## Other shorthandles with custom textdomain

Using following functions you must explicitly specify textdomain, useful if you have many textdomains in your app:

`_(singular, textdomain)` - single string translation

`_n(singular, plural, number, textdomain)` - plural translation

`_x(singular, context, textdomain)` - single string translation with context

`_nx(singular, plural, number, context, textdomain)` - plural translation with context

## Textdomain lookup algorithm

TranslationCenter looks for `.mo` or `.po` files with the following pattern:

`%app-bundle-path/%textdomain-%language.%extension`

where `%language` is a language two letter code (e.g. ru, en, es, etc..)
`%extension` is usually `mo` or `po`. `mo` files have higher priority since it's more compact format and supposed to be used for distribution.
`%textdomain` - default or your own textdomain that you specify in your source code.

Example path may look like that:

`/MyApp.app/default-es.mo`

## Build notes

### Manual

- Link your app against `libstdc++.dylib`

- Pomo-iphone depends on `muparser-iphone`. So at the end you'll have a workspace with `muparser-iphone` and `pomo-iphone` compiled in the same order as mentioned.

- Link your app against `libpomo-iphone`

### Automatic via CocoaPod

Add the following line in your Podfile:

`pod 'pomo-iphone', :git => 'git://github.com/pronebird/pomo-iphone.git'`

## Poedit Settings

If you use Poedit, follow the instructions below to setup Objective-C parser.

Go to Poedit > Preferences and add new parser with the following settings:

- List of extensions:
`*.m;*.mm;*.c;*.h;`

- Parser command:
`xgettext --force-po -o %o %C %K %F -L ObjectiveC`

- An item in keywords list:
`-k%k`

- An item in input files:
`%f`

- Source code charset:
`--from-code=%c`

Also you can use `--add-comments=/` flag in Parser commands to enable translators' comments. In this example all comments starting with triple slash will be treated as translators' comments.

## Poedit Catalog Settings

Setup the following keywords for your catalog to make Poedit work with your source code:

    _
    _x:2c,1
    _nx:4c,1,2
    _n:1,2
    _n_noop:1,2
    _nx_noop:3c,1,2
